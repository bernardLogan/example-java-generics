Example Java project created via STS as Java Project, showing how to;
- generic static methods (ShowMoreStaticGenericMethodsAndBounds, ShowStaticGenericMethodsAndBounds)
- generic class (MyGenericClass)
- generic interface (MyGenericInterface)
- "wild char" ? of generic
- "bound type" for interface
- "bound type" with muliple interface
- "bound type" with class
- "lower bound" of variable type
- "upper bound" of variable type
- "lower bound" of method input
- "upper bound" of method input

## Setup dependencies
Make sure on your machine, you have;
- git installed
- a working unix shell (like git bash. If not there install git and use its "git bash")
- working JDK installed (with JAVA_HOME env variable added, and PATH env variable prefixed with %JAVA_HOME%/bin)
